Study Control System - Central University of Venezuela

The Sociology School at Central University of Venezuela lacks control and automation causing severe issues for its community.

Some common problems are:

Lost notes from a professor.

Lost notes at Study Control Center.

Delay delivering notes report, to students.

Students coursing asignatures which are not allowed, according with study program.

Delay delivering the certificate of study, to students.


In order to solve those issues, I decided to develop and deliver and Study Control System to the Sociology School.

It will be developed using Django and PostgreSQL
